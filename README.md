# STM32F407_Project_DiscoveryBoard
This is a project made with the STM32 Discovery Board. The board is based on the STM32F407G MCU. The project is aimed to make all code and drivers from scratch and to get to know the MCU chip in details and examine its capabilities by creating examples. All this code is referenced to a course on Udemy.com, called "Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development".
